            <h4>Cozumel Pearl Farm</h4>
            <p>"... pearl farming (loved hearing their story and learning about the process of harvesting pearls), yummy grilled lunch (and they graciously accommodated my vegan request), relaxing hammocks, and such a beautiful day."</p>
            <p>"With Isabel, her crew and a small group (no crowds!), you get a beautiful boat ride, the best beach and softest sand on the island, cold drinks, great snacks, an interesting history/science lesson, diverse snorkel..."</p>

            <h4>Palancar Reef</h4>
            <p>"plenty of sea life, when lucky you will see a turtle or as in our case a stingray, If you are in love of the ocean you have to visit this and other closer reefs, my favorite is the one named "el cielo" with thousa..."</p>

            <p>"more of a shallow dive with lots of sea life to experience; can become a little crowded with divers and snorkelers from the cruise ships"</p>
            <h4>Columbia Reef</h4>
            <p>"It is a far deeper reef than I expected but as you stare down at the enormous structures you can see some incredible marine life such as Giant Eagle Rays, Sea Turtles, and Angle Fish."</p>
            <p>"We took a private guided day trip of Cozumel and it worked well to rent a car & drive to Palancar Beach Park and use one of their trips rather than take a trip from Cozumel...shortens the boat time, plus we could..."</p>
            <h4>El Paso del Cedral Reef</h4>
            <p>"Shallower dives (approx 60 ft) that provided a good variety of sea life, including moray feels, scorpion fish, pipe seahorse, hermit crabs, lobster, nurse shark, turtles."</p>

            <p>"Our fishing charter, Fishing with Pedro (find them on Facebook), brought us by for a break in fishing, and we played with the stingrays, some fish, and one obviously well fed barracuda."</p>
            <h4>Isla Pasion</h4>
            <p>"We visited Isla Pasion via a Carnival Cruise excursion at the start of August, This is a private beach which has beautiful white sand, and the water is blue or turquoise."</p>
